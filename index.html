        <div class="card">
          <p>Hi, and congratulations! Welcome to this training. If you’re watching this video, it means you’re about to start your shift solo. This also gives you access to all the tools and internal group chats on WhatsApp that you’ll need throughout your shift.</p>
          <p>Early shifts start at either 7 AM or 8 AM Sydney Time. Before logging in, make sure all your tools are ready. Also, take a moment to check recent announcements, as there may be updates that affect your duties as a receptionist.</p>
          <p>When you’re ready, send your login time to the “Staff clock in/out” group in Sydney Time.</p>
          <p>Once logged in and your tools are ready, the first thing to do is check the “HANDOVER (new)” group. Take note of any important endorsements from the previous receptionist on duty.</p>
          <p>If there are pending check-in endorsements, check if the guest has already arrived. If not, send a follow-up message to the guest. Then reply to the endorsement message accordingly.</p>
          <p>Next, open the “Azzurro - CHECK IN/CHECK OUTS” group to see the check-in and check-out information for today. Double-check the following against CloudBeds:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Same Room and Bed Extensions</li>
            <li>Moved Beds</li>
            <li>Check-ins and Check-outs</li>
            <li>Empty Beds</li>
            <li>Borrowed Items</li>
          </ul>
          <p>You can paste this info into your internal notes and keep CloudBeds open on the side for verification. If everything is accurate, reply to the message with a ✅. Make updates to your internal notes if necessary and reply with the updated list.</p>
          <p>Next, prepare a separate internal note to send to your property’s housekeeping group. This should include the list of rooms the cleaners need to prepare. The format is the same as the daily Check-in/Check-out Info, but:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Remove the guest names for check-ins</li>
            <li>Retain only the room and bed numbers</li>
            <li>Include a note confirming returned borrowed items at the bottom</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If Zoom restarts during your shift, you can ask the cleaner on duty for assistance by sending this prepared message.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Same Room and Bed Extensions</li>
            <li>Moved Beds</li>
            <li>Check-ins</li>
            <li>Last-Minute Check-ins (if applicable)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The early-shift receptionist is responsible for sending updated room details for guests extending their stay. This must be done before <b>10 AM</b>, as their current room access will automatically deactivate at that time.</p>
          <p><b>Remember</b>: For every action you take, always manually sync it in the Check-ins File by selecting the correct drop-down.</p>
          <p>For guests checking in, verify if they’ve completed the <b>digital check-in process</b>. Here’s how:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Go to Whistle</li>
            <li>Click Reservations (top right)</li>
            <li>Edit filters</li>
            <li>Select your property</li>
            <li>Select today’s arrival date</li>
            <li>Apply changes</li>
          </ol>
          <p>For guests who haven’t uploaded a valid Passport/ID, send a reminder. For guests who haven’t started the process at all, send a reminder as well. Be mindful of the message templates you use.</p>
          <p>Once a guest completes the process, mark Yes for both ID/Passport and Digital Registration.</p>
          <p>You may only release GOKI access once housekeeping confirms the rooms are made and ready for check-in. This usually happens around 2–3 PM.</p>
          <p>At exactly 10 AM, check out guests in CloudBeds. Some guests may drop by the reception for check-out. Ask for their room and bed number and check them out immediately. Checked-out guests will change from green to gray in the system.</p>
          <p>At the end of your shift, send an endorsement to the next receptionist. Send it to the “HANDOVER (new)” group before sending your log-out message to the “Staff clock in/out” group.</p>
          <p>That covers the main tasks for an early shift. While completing these, you’ll also accommodate guests in real-time and respond to messages across platforms.</p>
          <p>Good luck, and enjoy your shift!</p>

            <li>Rooms/Beds of Pending Check-ins</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Send this list to your property’s housekeeping group chat. Once the scheduled afternoon cleaner logs in, they will send it back to you to confirm if beds are made and ready for check-in, including for last-minute arrivals. You may follow the provided template for this list.</p>
          <p>As you go through your shift, you'll also need to send a check-in reminder to guests who are checking in the next day. You can do this by copying the reservation name from CloudBeds, pasting it into Whistle, and sending the check-in reminder template. After that, update your list accordingly.</p>
          <p>At the end of your shift, prepare and send an endorsement for the next receptionist. Send it to the “HANDOVER (new)” group before sending your log-out message to the “Staff clock in/out” group.</p>
          <p>And that’s it! Those are the main tasks assigned to the afternoon shift. Remember, while completing these tasks, you’ll also be accommodating live guests and responding to messages across platforms.</p>
          <p>Good luck, and enjoy your shift!</p>

          <p>The purpose of the graveyard shift is to keep overnight operations stable, maintain accurate reporting, monitor safety and systems, and ensure a smooth handover for the morning team.</p>
          <p>At 11:00 PM and again at 11:55 PM, send all reservations to Morgan. This includes new, modified, and pending bookings. Make sure the Daily Report Stats Sheet is updated and the link is included. Take time to verify occupancy, check-ins, and availability before sending.</p>
          <p>During the shift, send system and facility updates. This includes reporting the GOKI battery status and flagging any low battery warnings immediately. Internet speed test results should also be sent, with notes if the connection is unstable or slower than normal.</p>
          <p>Check the number of empty beds at the Allen location and send the total to the Overnight Group, tagging overnight staff. This information helps the team manage walk-ins, transfers, and emergencies overnight.</p>
          <p>Throughout the shift, continuously monitor guest complaints, CCTV feeds, and messaging platforms. Respond to issues within your scope, escalate urgent or safety-related concerns immediately, and log all incidents for the morning handover.</p>
          <p>At 5:00 AM, send the check-in list for the day. Ensure all expected arrivals are listed and highlight any early check-ins or special notes the morning team should be aware of.</p>
          <p>Before ending the shift, prepare a clear handover summary. This should include pending check-ins, unresolved complaints or incidents, any technical concerns such as GOKI, internet, or CCTV issues, and any follow-ups required by the morning team.</p>
